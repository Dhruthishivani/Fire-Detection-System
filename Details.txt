Components needed are:
An arduino and its adapter
Few jumper Wires
A fire sensor
A led
A breadboard
A buzzer
A lighter
 
The steps to setup hardware connections are listed below:

Connect "VCC" pin of the sensor to 5V pin on the arduino.
Connect "GND" ground pin to GND pin on the arduino.
Connect "AO" analog output pin to any analog or digital pins on the arduino.In this tutorial I connected it with A2
Connect longer LED leg to pin 13 on the arduino. If you want to use anyother pin on the arduino, you need to use a 220 ohm resistor.
Connect shorter LED leg to GND pin on the arduino.
FIx buzzer on the breadboard.
Connect longer buzzer leg to pin 11(or any other pin) on the arduino.
Connect shorter buzzer leg to GND pin on the arduino.
